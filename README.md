This is an app that lets you take selfies using NYC's live traffic cameras. (WORK IN PROGRESS)

A preview of the final site can be viewed at the GitHub page below (best viewed on mobile):

https://juliacodessometimes.github.io/selfie_nyc/ 

This page is really just used for front-end and design testing only and doesn't have any of the features served by a backend (for example, the ability to save/download selfies, or re-scrape the NYDOT website to check for new cameras). All the code for this version can be found in the [docs](https://github.com/juliacodessometimes/selfie_nyc/tree/main/docs) folder.


The code for what will eventually be the finished site (including a Flask backend and a Python file that scrapes NYDOT's website) can be found in the [app](https://github.com/juliacodessometimes/selfie_nyc/tree/main/app) folder. 

Once all the important features are implemented this is what will eventually be deployed. Stay tuned!!
