This is an app that lets you take selfies using NYC's live traffic cameras. (WORK IN PROGRESS)

To see a preview of the site go to https://juliacodessometimes.github.io/selfie_nyc/ (though it's best viewed on mobile). This page is used for front-end testing only; the full code for the back-end of the final site will be added soon and deployed elsewhere!
