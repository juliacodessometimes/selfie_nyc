This is an app that lets you take selfies using NYC's live traffic cameras. (WORK IN PROGRESS)

A preview of the final site can be viewed at the URL https://juliacodessometimes.github.io/selfie_nyc/ (best viewed on mobile). This page is really used for front-end testing only, but all the code for it can be found in the [docs] (https://github.com/juliacodessometimes/selfie_nyc/tree/main/docs) folder.

The code for the finished site can be found in the [app](https://github.com/juliacodessometimes/selfie_nyc/tree/main/app) folder
