    <h4>The camera feed image isn't changing!</h4>
    <br>
    <p>Be patient! Images are refreshed every second, but sometimes loading times can be slow. <br>
    Wait a few seconds, and if the image does not change, try refreshing the page. If you can, try connecting to WiFi.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>The image that appears says that the camera is being serviced</h4>
    <img src='assets/cctv.png' id='example'></img>
    <p>Sometimes this image appears when the camera feed url cannot be reached. Wait a few seconds for the feed to refresh again, and the actual camera feed should appear!<br>
    If the image is not replaced with a view of the street within 30 seconds, the camera feed may be down for that day.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>The location of the camera on the map isn't correct</h4>
    <br>
    <p>Some of the camera locations are not exact. If you find that a camera is nowhere near its shown location, please email selfienycwebsite@gmail.com</p>
